<h2 style = "text-align:center; font-size:1.4em;">Greetings Mozilla <span style = "text-decoration: line-through;">Builder</span> Internet Ecosystem Grant Program Reviewer!</h2>
<p>The purpose of <strong>oComponents</strong> is to make <i>embedding 3rd party functionality dramatically simpler</i>, so of course I couldn&#x27;t skip the opportunity in my application to give you some interactive examples that do just that!</p><p>In this document I'd like to give you some more in-depth background on <a href = "https://runkit.com/docs/embed">RunKit embeds</a>, the inspiration for <strong>oComponents</strong>, as well as showing you some demos of what a RunKit integration in <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">MDN Web Docs</a> could look like. Hopefully, this will provide a real-world example of the sorts of experiences that could become more commonplace after <strong>oComponents</strong> makes doing this sort of thing much simpler, both for publishers and consumers of these integrations.</p>
<h2>Enhancing Server-Side MDN Web Docs</h2>
<p>MDN Web Docs have become the de facto reference manual for the web, and currently do a great job of providing <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Live_samples">interactive documentation</a> for web technologies like (browser) JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. However, MDN has a harder time providing this sort of functionality for the server-side technologies it also documents:</p>
<ul><li>Many client-side web technologies, like WebSockets, require complementary server-side components in order to use. As explained <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Tools/Sample_server">here</a>, the <i>live sample</i> system falls short in these cases and thus requires the user to install various tools on their own systems in order to properly follow along.<br><br></li>
<li>MDN of course also aims to document several server-side technologies in their own right, from standard JavaScript in node.js to libraries like in this <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction">express tutorial</a>. Here too, the tutorial can't be nearly as interactive or "in place" as the client-side tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<p>RunKit can fill in the gap in both these use cases to give server-side documentation the same first class treatment as client-side documentation, being fully editable and runnable directly from the MDN site. Critically, it could also be as easily embeddable as the current client-side examples with the current templating system.</p>
<p>As a quick demonstration of what is possible, I've taken the existing Node.js Buffer API documentation and given it the "live sample" treatment. Click on the image below to see how Node APIs could be presented as interactively on MDN as the JavaScript DOM APIs are today:</p>
<p><a href="/buffer"><figure class="css-qv45bh"><img src="/assets/images/live-documentation.png" alt="Live Documentation Concept"/><figcaption>Every Page Can Be a Get Started Page</figcaption></figure></a></p>
<p>Similarly, tutorials that need to make use of a live server can do so when RunKit embeds are placed into <strong>endpoint mode</strong>, like <a href = "https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html">expressjs.com's own documentation</a> currently does today. MDN can take this a step further by having combining such a strategy with client-side elements, to give a full "end to end" interactive experience. Click the image below to see a small mockup of what such an experience could be like:</p>

<h2>Live Documentation - <a href="/buffer">Live Demo Link</a></h2><p>Before diving into the dedicated &quot;Getting Started&quot; page, we wanted to share our
belief that <em>every</em> page has the opportunity to get a user experimenting with
node. Partially inspired by Josh Ashkanas&#x27; work on <a href="http://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore.html">Literate Programming</a> as well
as Brett Victor&#x27;s famous talks, we fundamentally believe that any &quot;dead&quot; snippet
of code is a lost opportunity. In this demo we&#x27;ve taken the existing markdown
files that comprise the node documentation and made the substantial code samples
first class citizens â€“ meant to be interacted with directly to really see if
one understands the concepts.</p><p><a href="/buffer"><figure class="css-qv45bh"><img src="/assets/images/live-documentation.png" alt="Live Documentation Concept"/><figcaption>Every Page Can Be a Get Started Page</figcaption></figure></a></p><h2>Getting Started - <a href="/getting-started">Live Demo Link</a></h2><p>Our main goal with the &quot;Getting Started&quot; page we&#x27;re presenting is that we try
to specifically focus on what differentiates Node from other platforms, that
way new users can quickly understand <strong>why</strong> they&#x27;d want to use Node instead
of merely <strong>how</strong> to use Node. Additionally, we try to paint Node in the broad
strokes it represents, offering explanations for its various use cases beyond
just serving webpages -- all this while still maintaining interactivity.</p><p><a href="/getting-started"><figure class="css-qv45bh"><img src="/assets/images/getting-started.png" alt="Getting Started Concept"/><figcaption>Dedicated Lessons That Focus on What Differentiates Node</figcaption></figure></a></p><h2>Who Uses RunKit?</h2><p>These great sites have already integrated</p><ul><li><a href="http://npmjs.com">NPM</a></li><li><a href="http://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html">Express</a></li><li><a href="https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5">Lodash</a></li><li><a href="https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/">Facebook Immutable</a></li><li><a href="http://ramdajs.com/docs/">Ramda</a></li><li><a href="https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/use-with-node-js">Font Awesome</a></li><li><a href="http://stripe.com/">Stripe</a></li></ul><h2>Why RunKit?</h2><ul><li><p>We&#x27;re here to help! And we enjoy it! Use cases like this are why we started this
project so we&#x27;re super excited to contribute however we can, and assist in whatever
way is needed if you decide to use RunKit. It also goes without saying that this
service would be completely free.</p></li><li><p><strong>module-fs</strong> is by far our most important technology, as Node more than any other
platform is fundamentally a community effort through the amazing package ecosystem that
has built up around it. I think we should be highlighting this both for its technical merits
but also for its amazing accessibility.</p></li><li><p>We are dedicated to supporting every major version of Node forever. One of our main
use cases is <a href="https://blog.runkit.com/2017/02/01/stop-filing-bugs-file-a-container/">filing bugs</a>,
and we thus consider it our responsibility to maintain the reproducibility of those bugs
forever. We&#x27;d love to discuss the possibility of supporting <em>nightly Node builds</em> in the docs as well.</p></li><li><p>The code lives on your site! We hate the idea of the fundamental components of websites
being separated across privately administered databases. We want it to be easy to manage and
edit your code through your existing PR flow, and even to take your code somewhere else.</p></li><li><p>RunKit is totally themable - pictured below is the custom theme Stripe uses on their home
page.</p></li></ul><p><figure class="css-qv45bh"><img src="/assets/images/stripe.png" alt="Showing Stripe&#x27;s Green Theme"/><figcaption>RunKit is themable!</figcaption></figure></p><ul><li><p>RunKit is <strong>fast</strong>. We completely re-architected our embeds to support hundreds of
simultaneously running examples on a page. We consider projects like the nodejs website
redesign to be our primary use case and have invested heavily in it.</p></li><li><p>RunKit is a full member of TC39 and deeply interested in the future of JavaScript as a whole.</p></li></ul><h2>Contact</h2><p>The RunKit team is always happy to help, I&#x27;ve listed the members below:</p><div><style>
